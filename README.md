# Neomorph FrameLayout
 I got this project from : https://github.com/4inodev/Neomorphic-FrameLayout-Android
 I added some attributes for useing it in better way.

## Attributes:
```"neomorph_padding_top"``` -  set padding top to view, if "0dp" passed for this, The view wouldn't have top evalation<br>
```"neomorph_padding_bottom"``` -  set padding top to view, if "0dp" passed for this, The view wouldn't have bottom evalation <br>
```"neomorph_padding_right"``` - set padding top to view, if "0dp" passed for this, The view wouldn't have right evalation <br>
```"neomorph_padding_left"``` -  set padding top to view, if "0dp" passed for this, The view wouldn't have left evalation <br>
```"neomorph_selected_color"``` - When you are using Neomorph for parent of button and you want to set background color to it, use this.<br>
```"neomorph_selected_padding"``` - Padding for background color<br>
```"neomorph_style"``` - style could be "stroke" or "fill" <br>

### Recommendation:
 I did n't use this view because it's not good for complicated UI, I reccommned you to use this library :
 Neumorphism in Android -> https://github.com/fornewid/neumorphism {I use this for my project, it's not too much heavy in Rendaring the view.}
 Or
 Android Neumorphism Design -> https://www.uplabs.com/posts/android-neumorphism-library
